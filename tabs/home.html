            I have experience in the following programming languages and frameworks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong> (Flask)</li>
            <li><strong>Java</strong> (Spring)</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> (Vue.js, React)</li>
            <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> (Angular)</li>
            <li><strong>SQL</strong></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m passionate about continuing to improve my coding skills by working on small projects, some of which I will make publicly available to contribute to the developer community.
